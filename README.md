'RefNo':'1',
'Memo':'POS and Version go here',
'Purchase':'1.00',
'Frequency':'OneTime',
'RecordNo':'RecordNumberRequested',
'EncryptedFormat':'MagneSafe',

'EncryptedBlock':'2F8248964608156B2B1745287B44CA90A349905F905514ABE3979D7957F13804705684B1C9D5641C',
'EncryptedKey':'9500030000040C200026',
'OperatorID':'operatorid'
});
```

## Step 2: Create request object

```
var reqPost = https.request(optionspost, function(res) {
    res.on('data', function(d) {
        console.info('POST result:\n');
        process.stdout.write(d);
        console.info('\n\nPOST completed');
    });
});
```

## Step 3: Write JSON object to request

```
reqPost.write(jsonObject);
reqPost.end();
```
